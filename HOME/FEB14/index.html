      This is the story of me and Pema Yangzin (Ranjeeta), my first love. 
      Although we had known each other since 4th grade, our story didn’t 
      begin till we were in the freshman year of high-school. Yangzin , 
      a girl from Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, used to sit in front of me 
      during prayer, as our roll numbers were next to each other.
      <br>
      As Yangzin is from Kinnaur, she knew some old Ladakhi song. So, 
      sometimes we used to sing some of those songs together, songs 
      like "Ama Lay Julay" and "Urpay Shokpa Yodna” were our favourites. 
      She's very talented in singing and good in languages. Her voice 
      is still ringing in my ears as I am writing this. Contrary to 
      her I was very weak in language so Pema being the kind girl 
      that she is, used to help me with English.
      <br><br>
      Talking about this story reminded me of another story, around 
      5th grade a friend of mine used to be in a relationship with 
      a senior girl and since they didn’t want their relationship 
      to be known publicly, I used to be a messenger for them. My 
      job was to take letters back and forth without looking, but 
      I always betrayed them by reading their letters before passing 
      them on to the right person. Through those letters, I could 
      feel the beauty of the relationship that they shared. 
      Sometimes, I even acted as a watchman for them. This went 
      on for about three years and then they broke up, but I never 
      knew how or why they broke up. I witnessed the beginning of 
      their relationship, but I wasn’t able to witness the end. 
      I didn't have the courage to ask. Later, that girl became 
      like a sister to me, and she used to help me by washing my clothes. 
      It was a very sad moment for me, for two reasons only: 
      <br> 
      1. I would not be able to read the love letters anymore, and 
      <br>
      2. I was no longer their watchman.
      <br>
      <br>
      <hr class="hr1">
      <br>
      Since we have already taken a detour from our original story 
      let me take this time to tell you a little bit more about my 
      school life. I completed my 8th class by achieving the highest 
      marks in math, scoring a perfect 100 out of 100. This was a 
      record in my school's history, and I believe my achievement 
      still stands in the school records. Everyone used to call me 
      "100/100", including the staff members and the villagers. 
      Even today whenever I get a call from my school friends, 
      they  tease me by saying, "Yehhhh, maths topper!"
      <br>

    <p id="paraMP">
      During my time, Ladakhi students used to go home during 
      summer holidays only (I used to live in a dorm, if it 
      wasn’t apparent before). So during the 50 day winter
      holidays all Ladakhi students, mostly from Zanskar, 
      studying in different Tibetan schools stayed to my school. 
      Because I was the only Ladakhi student, I faced a lot of 
      discrimination in school and hostel as 99% of the students 
      were from Arunachal Pradesh. For the first few years I used 
      to be happy to hear that Ladakhi people would be joining me 
      during the winter holidays, but I faced discrimination even 
      from them because I am not from Zanskar. It was the same 
      every year and this year was no different. I used to struggle 
      every day to cope with the discrimination from them. Finally 
      the winter holidays came to an end.

  <div class="Birthday" id="phoneMargin">
    <p id="paraMP">
    
      <br>
      We had maths, my favorite subject, as our first class of 9th 
      grade (probably a sign of good luck?). Time passed and we 
      moved from one chapter to another. I remember many of my 
      classmates struggled with "Polynomials”.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Interestingly, I found it pretty easy. In the Tibetan community, 
      there is a common belief that Tibetans are weak in maths while 
      Indians were considered good at it.
      My skill in math were often credited to my Indian heritage, with 
      many simply stating, "I'm good at math because I'm Indian," 
      a notion that was widely accepted as its easier to believe.
      
      <br><br>
      As the class went on, the teachers did their best to explain 
      the concepts to everyone. However, many students still found 
      it difficult to grasp. Yangzin, too struggled in maths, she had 
      passed 8th grade maths by a small margin. One day she approached 
      me for help in this example.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0,0,0); font-size: smaller; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
        Example 6 : Divide p(x) by g(x), where p(x) = x + 3x<span style="color: black;"><sup>2</sup></span> – 1 and g(x) = 1 + x. 
        <!-- <br>
        (i)  – x<span style="color: black;"><sup>4</sup></span> + 3 
        <br>(ii) 2 – y<span style="color: black;"><sup>2</sup></span> – y<span style="color: black;"><sup>3</sup></span> + 2y<span style="color: black;"><sup>8</sup></span> 
      </span> -->
      </span>
      <br>
      <br>
      I did my best to explain the concepts to her, and 
      to my surprise, she soon exclaimed, "This is so easy! Why 
      couldn't I understand it before?". Over time, she started 
      solving problems with me, but she still lacked basic math 
      skills. So, I began teaching Yangzin and some of my other 
      classmates after school. As a result, everyone started 
      enjoying math a bit more.

      <br><br>
      I've liked her since childhood, but if you were to ask me whether 
      she's beautiful or not, I wouldn't have an answer. To this day, 
      I don't have a specific definition of what makes someone beautiful 
      or any standards in my mind. Unlike many who compare individuals 
      to some ideal type in their minds, I find myself drawn to people 
      who are friendly and helpful by nature. Despite harboring feelings 
      for her since seventh grade, I never had the courage to directly 
      confess.


      <br>
      <br>
      One day, while we were solving math questions in the corner of 
      the class, I finally mustered the courage to whisper those three 
      long-awaited words to her: <span id="ilikeyou">"I like you" </span>  
      In an instant, she hastily left her desk and sat at the front seat 
      with a shy, red face (I found myself blushing too). After the class, 
      I was overwhelmed with shyness and regret, wondering why I said 
      those words to her, especially during class. Later that night, 
      I couldn't shake off the feeling of regret. I was worried that 
      our strong friendship  might have been broken because of my confession.

      <br>
      For a couple of days, she didn't speak to me, and whenever we found 
      ourselves together, there was an awkward tension, especially during 
      our prayers in the hall where I sat behind her. The feeling persisted 
      for many days, making me increasingly uncomfortable. Then, one day 
      during self-study time in the Common Hall, a junior approached me 
      and handed me a letter (déjà-vu). I had no idea what it was about 
      until I opened it. Although it wasn’t directly written but based on 
      the content of the letter, I figured out that she was saying yes 
      indirectly.

      <br>
      <br>
      
      Our relationship began with that letter. After 10th grade, I 
      laminated the letter, and to this day it rests in a file in my 
      bedroom. Whenever I read it, I'm filled with nostalgia. 
      The next day, she approached me with math questions like she used
      to. While I was explaining the questions to her, she mentioned that 
      she had trouble understanding math for the past couple of days 
      because I wasn't there to help her (silently blushing inside).

      Our relationship followed a pattern similar to that of my friends', 
      secretly exchanging letters during class making sure that none of our 
      classmates take a notice. We opted not to involve a third party like 
      I was for my friends due to my lack of trust in them. So, we continued 
      our exchanges during class sessions. We didn't need to a watchman as 
      we never moved from letters.
      We both tried to meet alone after class and during holidays a couple 
      of times, but we lacked the courage and feared what others would say 
      if they caught us together.

      The story continued like this till 10th-grade board exams, 
      and nobody suspected our relationship. That's how well we 
      were at keeping it a secret from others. After the board exams, 
      it was time to bid farewell to the school that nurtured me and 
      molded me into a resilient young man prepared to navigate the realms 
      of competition and technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      On the last day of school, graduation day, and all my 
      classmates were in tears as we bid farewell to the memories, 
      the beautiful campus, and our teachers and friends. I tried my 
      best to hold back my tears, being a boy. However, when I saw 
      Yangzin crying, my tears flowed uncontrollably, and I rushed 
      to the washroom, where I cried like a baby for a minutes.
      <br>
      <br>
      As each classmate took their turn leaving for their own destinations, 
      it was finally my turn to depart for Ladakh. In our last hours together 
      at school, she held my bag along with some remaining classmates. Everyone 
      came to drop me off at the bus stop.
      <br>
      I really wanted to hug her tightly, but with my classmates around, 
      I had to hug everyone in the class so that they don’t get 
      suspicious about us.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The moment arrived when the bus to Delhi pulled up. I hugged all my 
      classmates, saving Yangzin for last. I hugged her so tightly that 
      tears began to well up, both for me and for her. As I boarded the bus, 
      they all waved goodbye, except Yangzin, who was wiping away her tears. 
      I was also teary-eyed, and my entire journey was spent crying. When I 
      reached Delhi, my sister asked, "What happened to your eye? It's so 
      swollen." My response was simply, "Nothing, I just couldn't sleep on the bus."

      Through our stream of conversation via letters, we decided to 
      enrol in Bengaluru for 11th grade, in a branch of my school, 
      opting for the non-medical stream.
      <br>
      On last day, we got our first ever phones and exchanged numbers.
      <br><br>    
      We exchanged messages and talked on the phone every day for more than a 
      month, and then unexpectedly, the results came out while I was playing 
      football in the boys' school. I checked her results first, then mine, 
      and we were both delighted to see that we had passed. I was surprised 
      by her math mark, which was 83%. She had not only passed but also achieved 
      the second-highest marks in math, with me being the first. That night, 
      during a video call, I congratulated her, and together we imagined our 
      future at the school in Bengaluru.
      <br>
      <br>
      <hr class="hor" >
      
      After 2 days, I received an unexpected message from her stating 
      that her father was insisting her to pursue medical studies,  
      in Shimla. We talked for hours about trying to convince her 
      father to let her study in Bangalore, but his decision was final. 
      At that moment, I felt the downward shift in our relationship. 
      Despite our plans to study together, I decided to join Bengaluru, 
      feeling incredibly sad about the situation. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The following day, 
      similar to her father's approach, my own father came to me and 
      asked whether I wanted to join Lamdon or not. His proposal caught 
      me off guard, as I had never considered studying in Ladakh. However, 
      I accepted the offer because she wasn't coming to Bengaluru either. 
      So, I took admission in Lamdon while she pursued her studies in Shimla.
      <br>
      <br>
      We continued exchanging messages as usual, but I couldn't 
      envision a future for us. Time passed, and we both passed our 
      12th grade exams with high marks. She joined a nursing college 
      in Delhi.
      <br>
      <br>
      <hr class="hor" >
      During the lockdown, I suffered from severe back pain and went 
      to AIIMS Delhi for a checkup. It was during this time that 
      I met Yangzin after two years at Majnu Ka Tilla, and we had 
      our first dinner date. Both of us had changed considerably 
      as puberty had taken its course; she had become even more beautiful, 
      while I had grown taller. We reflected on our shared memories 
      and experiences.
      <br><br>
      During our conversation, we discussed our relationship and came 
      to the conclusion that there was no future for us. So, we made 
      the difficult decision to end our relationship, and we did so 
      during the dinner.
      <br><br>
      It was a very sad moment for both of us, but ultimately, 
      we felt it was the right decision for us to separate. We 
      realized that we were different in every sense, from our

      We continued to exchange messages and calls, though not as 
      frequently as before.

      During the last summer holidays, on my way back to Leh, 
      we found ourselves dining at the same restaurant, seated 
      at the same table, reminiscent of old times. I asked her 
      about her current relationship status, and she shared that 
      she was now with a boy from kinnaur community, expressing 
      her happiness. Curiously, she inquired about my relationship 
      status, to which I replied with a bittersweet smile, 
      reminiscing about the courage I had mustered during the 
      time I confessed my feelings to her with a simple "I like you." 
      Since then, I had never found that courage to approach another 
      girl or engage in such conversations. However, I was fortunate 
      to have a

      I am trying to move on and my life is slowly getting back on track, 
      but still sometimes I encounter diversions involving you, but I try my 
      best to stay on my own path. Occasionally, for a couple of days, 
      I find myself wavering and moving on your tack again, but I know 
      your path will never accept me running on it. So, I try to redirect 
      myself back onto my own track, reassuring myself that I will encounter 
      better diversions, but still, I waver.

      <hr class="hor" >
      This cycle repeats again and again for a couple of months. Then, 
      on Valentine's Day while I was in class I received a message on 
      WhatsApp from an unknown number. When I checked it, I wasn’t 
      expecting a proposal. At first, I thought it might be a prank 
      by one of my friends. The number claimed to be a girl who was 
      my good friend since the first year. I replied back,"Stop kidding 
      around." Then, the unknown number responded, stating that she is 
      Anamika, whom I know—a girl from Bangladesh studying in Geo 
      Engineering, 3rd year.
      <br>
      <br>
      I still thought it was like a prank and my head was running these 
      random thoughts-“why would she like me”, “it was probably part of 
      a game” and this kind of thing only happens in movies where boys 
      propose to girls on specific dates, like Valentine's Day. I didn't 
      take it too seriously, but later that day i found her waiting in 
      front of my department. I thought she was waiting for her other 
      friends from Bangladesh who were studying in my department. I 
      just waved my hand to her, and she came to me and said, "I like you." 
      I was like, "What is this?" with a red face. I replied with okay, as 
      I didn't know what to say at that time since I had never encountered 
      this situation before.

      <br>
      <br>
      Later that night, she messaged me, asking if I was single and expressing 
      her desire to be in a relationship. I just viewed the message from the 
      notification bar, pretending not to have seen it for two days. I spent 
      that time revisiting my past and contemplating what to do. Despite my 
      efforts to move my focus on her, your face kept coming into my mind, 
      giving me hope (I still waver). I tried my best to forget about you, 
      but it was not possible. Her offer seemed like a good way to move on 
      from you, so I finally said yes by asking her, "Why do you like me?".

      <br>
      <br>
      <hr class="hor" >
      She looked me in the eye and replied-"I like you because you're 
      genuine and kind-hearted. You have a warmth about you that draws 
      people in, and I've always admired your ability to make others 
      feel valued and appreciated. You're also incredibly thoughtful and 
      considerate, always going out of your way to make those around you 
      feel special. Your sense of humor never fails to brighten my day, 
      and I love how we can share laughter together. Beyond that, I admire 
      your ambition and drive to pursue your passions and goals in life. 
      You have a unique perspective on the world, and I find our 
      conversations both stimulating and enriching. Overall, there's 
      something about you that just clicks with me, and I feel a genuine 
      connection that I haven't felt with anyone else. That's why I like 
      you”. Or at least that’s what I thought her reply would be like.

      <br><br>
      However, her actual response caught me off guard. She said, "Don't know, 
      I just started liking you from the department's day basketball tournament".
      <br><br>
      Now I don’t know how this relationship will end, whether we 
      would date for the next two years and grow apart after I 
      graduate or whether I would not be able to handle the guilt 
      of not being committed to her and still harbouring feelings 
      for you and end the relationship.

      But I want to give this a chance, because I think I am finally ready 
      to let you go and walk confidently on my own path. Although I can no 
      longer see a destination ahead of me and at each diversion that I take 
      all I see is an endless road but I am hopeful, hopeful that one day the 
      right diversion would find my way and until that day comes I will keep 
      making turns in the hope that one of these turns would lead to my destiny.
